# How to get started with machine learning?
## How machine learning came into existence?
In my first blog post, I am gonna share some words out there with folks who have just gotten started with machine learning or are looking to make some breakthrough and have been 
into this field for a while. What I find most amusing about this field is that how it has achieved sudden popularity in the last few decades although it has came into existence 
since the 1940's when Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician built the first ever artificial neuron, Mark I Perceptron inspired from the neuron in our 
brain. Rosenblatt wrote about this work: >We are now about to witness the birth of such a machine—a machine capable of perceiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings 
without any human training or control.
The perceptron was built and was able to successfully recognize simple shapes. No sooner had he built the first artificial neuron that one 
of his colleges wrote a paper citing the incapabilities of a neuron and that a single could do nothing but only a bunch of neurons could carry out some mathematical functions. Most 
people did not notice the second part of the statement and soon the craze for machine machine learning halted for a while till no sooner than the 1980's did most of the 
significant researches were carried out in this field which were certainly made possible with a second layer of neurons. There are a lot of prominent personalities involved in 
this field which has made machine learning as easy and convinient to learn today compared to just a decade or two ago. One of the most significant developements in this field was 
the birth of deep learning which has made tasks a reality with accuracies which seemed nearly unbelievable just a decade ago and was made possible due to the very reach of the 
internet which has grown significantly in the last few years and has lead to the creation of surplus amounts of data which is the very backbone of machine learning. Deep learning is basically 
a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far 
from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. 
## What courses to follow?
Well, for a beginner who is looking to make some breakthrough in this field has a number of options available to learn the very basics and then master the practical aspects of 
machine learning through a variety of courses available on Coursera, Udemy, Fastai or any other platform. I won't particularly advise one over the other rather I would advise to 
go for the one which most appeals the needs of the person. For instance, [Machine learning by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) could be a really good choice for someone who has close to no experience as 
a coder and is just getting started. Someone who is looking to nail the fundamentals of machine learning with some practical projects in hand could go for [deep learning course 
from Deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?=&page=1). For one who is well acquainted with the fundamentals and is looking ahead to master the practical aspects of deep learning can go for the [Fastai course](https://course.fast.ai/) along 
with following the prescribed book [Deep learning for coders with fastai and pytorch](https://www.amazon.in/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/ref=asc_df_1492045527/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=396988721232&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11434087357020431143&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=21336&hvtargid=pla-917301026067&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi) which make use of the very fast and efficient fastai library which make the process of dataset 
loading to the training process a really easy and convinient process. Frankly speaking, I have completed all of these courses. So, if you are someone like I was a few time back, 
a complete newbie,
you could go with all of them starting with the very basics. 
## Few useful tips
There are a few key points which I would suggest before you would get started with the course of your choice
- Make some notes of the course lessons that you will take up next. It could prove to really powerful in the future to review the lessons that you would have learned.
- Read some research papers after you have got the basics from the lessons. They will give you really good understanding of some of the powerful algorithms developed.
- Try to learn from people who are into this field from a long time. You may get connected with them on linkedin.
- Today, we have a wide range of resources to learn from. Apart from the coures, you can refer to books, listen podcasts and read some newsletters.
- If you aren't aware now, you will sooner know that there are a few machine learning frameworks which make programming really easy and convinient. A few years ago, tensorflow was widely used and now pytorch has been able to take over Tensorflow. Tommorow, there might be some other framework. So, keep yourself flexible enough to be able to learn any new framework that may come up tommorow 
- After you have completed the above courses, take some real world projects. Maybe, you could get started with the basic ones. You can make the most out of [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to get exposure to some good projects.

Above all, what really works is your efforts. You can't expect to become a expert at machine learning in a month but experts say, if your efforts are in the right direction, then you could become one in some six months or so. So, keep learning and exploring! :+1:
