# How to get started with machine learning
In my first blog post, I am gonna share some words out there with folks who have just gotten started with machine learning or are looking to make some breakthrough who have been 
into this field for a while. What I find most amusing about this field is that how it has achieved sudden popularity in the last few decades although it has came into existence 
since the 1940's when Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician built the first ever artificial neuron, Mark I Perceptron inspired from the neuron in our 
brain. Rosenblatt wrote about this work: “We are now about to witness the birth of such a machine—a machine capable of perceiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings 
without any human training or control.” The perceptron was built and was able to successfully recognize simple shapes. No sooner had he built the first artificial neuron that one 
of his colleges wrote a paper citing the incapabilities of a neuron that a single could do nothing but a bunch of neurons could carry out some mathematical functions. Most 
people did not notice the second part of the statement and soon the craze for machine machine learning halted for a while till no sooner than the 1980's did most of the 
significant researches were carried out in this field which were certainly made possible with a second layer of neurons. There are a lot of prominent personalities involved in 
this field which has made machine learning as easy and convinient to learn today compared to just a decade or two ago. One of the most significant developements in this field was 
the birth of deep learning which has made tasks a reality which accuracies which seemed nearly unbelievable just a decade ago which was made possible due to the very reach of the 
internet which has grown significantly in the last few years which has lead to surplus amounts of data which is the very backbone of machine learning. Deep learning is basically 
a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers. These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain—albeit far 
from matching its ability—allowing it to “learn” from large amounts of data. 
Well, for a beginner who is looking to make some breakthrough in this field has a number of options available to learn the very basics and then master the practical aspects of 
machine learning through a variety of courses available on Coursera, Udemy, Fastai or any other platform. I won't particularly advise one over the other rather I would advise to 
go for the one which most appeals the needs of the person. For instance, Machine learning by Andrew Ng could be a really good choice for someone who has close to no experience as 
a coder and is just getting started. Someone who is looking to nail the fundamentals of machine learning with some practical projects in hand could go for deep learning course 
from Deeplearning.ai. For one who is well acquainted with the fundamentals and is looking ahead to master the practical aspects of deep learning can for the Fastai course along 
with following the prescribed book 'Deep learning for coders with fastai and pytorch' which make use the very fast and efficient fastai library which make the process of dataset 
loading to the training process a really easy and convinent process. Frankly speaking, I have completed all of these courses. So, if you are someone like I was a few time back,
you could go with all of them starting with the very basics. 
There are a few key points which I would suggest before you would get started with your favourite course
- Dont stick to any particular machine learning language forever as python was not always the most popular machine learning language. So, make yourself as much flexible that if a new language pops out overnight which takes the world of artificial intelligence by storm then you would n't have much problem switching to a new language
- If you do not know now, you will sooner know that there a few machine learning frameworks which make programming really easy as convinient. A few years ago, tensorflow was widely used and now pytorch has been able to provide better functionality. Tommorow, there might be some other framework. So, again keep yourself flexible in this aspect too.
